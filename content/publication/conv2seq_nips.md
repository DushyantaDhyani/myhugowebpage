[A Convolutional Encoder Model for Neural Machine Translation](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P/P17/P17-1012.pdf)) for sequence to sequence modeling using Pytorch. While the aim of the tutorial is to make the audience comfortable with pytorch using this tutorial (with a Conv2Seq implementation as an add on), some familiarity with pytorch (or any other deep learning framework) would definitely be a plus."
